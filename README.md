This repository is contains my notes for APAI1001 Course at The University of Hong Kong and the code associated with it.


Please note that the algorithms in Graph Search is modified for efficiency. Essentially, we check if the current node's next one is the target instead of checking if the current node is the solution. Saves one step.
